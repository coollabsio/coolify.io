                    At coolLabs Technologies Bt. ("we", "us", or "our"), we
                    create services and applications ("products") under the

                    safetyper.com, and all subdomains, as well as potentially
                    other services we may launch. Our goal is to provide a
                    secure place for your online information, and we own and
                    operate these platforms. We are committed to not
                    transferring your data to any external company unless
                    required by law.

                    their content or privacy practices, and this policy does not

                    How We Protect Your Information

                    We store your email address securely on servers within the
                    European Union, using encryption and access controls to
                    prevent unauthorized access. If we ever need to transfer
                    your data outside the EU (e.g., for backups or service
                    providers), we'll ensure safeguards like standard
                    contractual clauses are in place to protect it, as required
                    by GDPR.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    We keep your data only as long as necessary to provide the
                    services you've requested or as required by law. Once you
                    delete your account or no longer use our services, we retain
                    your email address for a short period (e.g., 30 days) for
                    administrative purposes, then securely delete it.
